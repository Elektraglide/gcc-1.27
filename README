----------

Modified to be compiled for Uniflex 2.2 on Tektronix 4404 68010 system
Native toolchain dies compiling almost any of these files so using a modern gcc cross m68k toolchain
elf32touniflex converts .o files to native Uniflex .r files  (see https://github.com/Elektraglide/tek4404)
Uniflex native toolchain uses + for commandline options and generally no spaces,  eg +o=outputfile  and not -o outputfile so requires changes to gcc
Uniflex uses \015 as newline; TARGET_NEWLINE is not consistently applied to terminal output
